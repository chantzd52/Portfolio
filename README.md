The Gaming Room client commissioned the development of a multiplayer drawing and guessing game called "Draw It or Lose It." The game had to fulfill several specific requirements, such as supporting multiple instances and players, rendering high-quality images within 30 seconds, and providing a seamless experience across different platforms. Additional features like user profiles, teams, and scoring were also integral to the design.

My documentation for this project was particularly robust in discussing key technical aspects, including memory and storage management. Strategies for implementing caching, content delivery networks, and image compression were carefully laid out to optimize both user experience and system performance. If I were to go back and revise any part of the document, it would be the requirements section; even though it was not originally a project requirement, adding it would bring a better structure and clarity to the design document.

User experience was at the forefront of all design decisions, from image rendering speed to reducing latency in multiplayer modes. Considering the user's needs is crucial as it directly impacts the software's adoption rate, customer satisfaction, and overall success. The design approach was deeply rooted in analyzing both client requirements and anticipated user needs, setting the stage for defining system architecture and key technical decisions. In future projects, I would keep a similar approach but aim to incorporate prototyping and user feedback sessions in the design process to validate design choices more effectively.
